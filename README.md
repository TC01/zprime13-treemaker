# zprime13-treemaker

The treemaker for the 13TeV version of the zprime analysis (both channels). 

Probably will be ported to https://github.com/TC01/Treemaker as plugins
later once Ben gets around to it.

This is intended to run over Janos's B2G ttrees, which are almost-direct
conversions of the new 13 TeV ntuples.
